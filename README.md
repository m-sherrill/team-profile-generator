# Team Profile Generator
  
## Description

This is a node.js application that runs in the terminal to generate an HTML page with your team roster. There are 3 clases of employee this application will accept. One "Manager" and any number of "Engineers" or "Interns" you desire. You will be taken through a series of prompt starting with the team manager information and then moving into the inidividual employee information. At the end, you will have a generated html page displaying your team. I have included a sample below in this README of the expected output. 

If you find the need for extra employee classes beyond "Engineer" and "Intern", please contact me for each new class to be consider in future development. 

## Installation

- This application requires node.js. Make sure this is installed on your computer first.
- Clone this repository to your computer. 
- Open the index.js file in your terminal and run ```npm install```. This will install inquirer and jest to your folder. 

## Usage

- Once Inquirer is installed, run ```node index.js``` in the terminal and answer the prompts.
- All prompts will show in the terminal and need to be answered there. 
- First the information for the team manager needs to be inputed, then there will be an option to add the rest of the team. 

## Testing 

Tests can be run in the terminal with Jest. Once you have completed the ```npm install``` from installation of this application. Run ``` npm run test``` from your terminal to view the included tests. All tests are located in the ```__tests__``` directory.
